### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Vedant Chaudhari

I am an avid learner and constantly look for areas and projects to implement the skills I have learned. I have a fair understanding of the Python programming language including Object-Oriented Programming concepts. I regularly practice coding and try to discover new concepts and libraries.
